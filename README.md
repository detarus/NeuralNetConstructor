# Just a Neural Net Constructor

## A C# Windows Forms project made with Microsoft Visual Studio

### This is my old diploma project that actually is based on examples from Accord framework


#### [Click here](http://accord-framework.net/samples#) to look at these examples by yourself


### To run the project you will need to install the following packages:

1. Accord.3.8.2-alpha (or higher)
2. Accord.Controls.3.8.0 (or higher)
3. Accord.Genetic.3.8.0 (or higher)
4. Accord.MachineLearning.3.8.0 (or higher)
5. Accord.Math.3.8.0 (or higher)
6. Accord.Neuro.3.8.0 (or higher)
7. Accord.Statistics.3.8.0 (or higher)
8. ZedGraph.5.1.7 (or higher)

#### It is pretty simple and easy-to-use so doesn't need to be actually FAQ-ed but if you'll catch any unobvious moments feel free to go in Issues Section 
#### And ofcourse i'll be very glad if you'll like to add any pull request that you think are needed
